## My Process

I started this project by first writing the respective HTML codes and CSS styling and finally JavaScript.

### Built With 

- HTML5 Markup
- CSS Styling

### What I Learned 

I practiced my knowledge of Javascript in building a responsive personalized app, having more knowledge of JavaScript Dom manipulation.

### Useful Resources 

Resource 1 - [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dom-manipulation-in-javascript/]

Resource 2 - [https://blog.logrocket.com/localstorage-javascript-complete-guide/]

Resource 3 - [https://www.theclientside.net/dom/dom-handling-form-submissions/]

This helped me while I was brainstorming on how to use JavaScript Dom manipulation for personalized greeting app accordingly without interrupting other command.
